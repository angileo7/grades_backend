# Backend grades system made in Rails api

### Angel's pairing Session Challenge

We want to create a gradesâ€™ system where only some registered admin users can access it and handle the CRUD of students, courses, and regarding a specific student, the CRUD of its grades as well.

A student should have at least 2 fields for identifying it, and a course at least one.

A student can take more than one course at a time

We only want to authorize access to the system to some registered users.


## commands to make it works


### `bundle install`

### `rails s`

Runs the app in [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).
